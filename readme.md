## This will probably (hopefully) the last time I completely rewrite this

I have previously tried to just make the game with a simple featured "game engine". Well didn't turn out to be very functional, I almost always ran into problems. Now I came up with a modular design, that works by loading shared libraries, which will be loaded dynamically into the program. 
This should allow extensive modding and basically makes this a very simple engine, if you just ignore all the game libraries/replace them.
I am excited to see how this will play out.
Note that i dont intend to support more than 2D for this. everything 3D related sounds to complicated to write it myself, I dont want to deal with it.
